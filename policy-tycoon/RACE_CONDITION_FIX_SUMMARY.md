# Race Condition Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the race condition between terrain generation and environmental feature generation in the Policy Tycoon project.

## Problem Description

The issue was that environmental features (trees, forests) were being generated before the terrain was fully rendered, causing:

1. "Terrain generation with chunking and instancing complete" - appearing prematurely
2. "Generating world..." - appearing later, indicating ongoing terrain generation
3. Environmental features being placed incorrectly or not at all

## Solution Implemented

### 1. TerrainGenerationService Modifications

**File:** [src/app/application/services/terrain-generation.service.ts](file://d:\dev\github\policy-tycoon\github\policy-tycoon\src\app\application\services\terrain-generation.service.ts)

**Changes:**
- Added EventEmitter `terrainComplete` to notify when terrain generation is fully complete
- Added `TerrainData` interface for better type safety
- Modified `generateWorld()` to emit terrain completion event with proper terrain data
- Added helper methods:
  - `getAllCoordinates()` - Get all terrain coordinates
  - `getTerrainTypeAt()` - Get terrain type at specific coordinates

### 2. MapRendererService Modifications

**File:** [src/app/presentation/services/map-renderer.service.ts](file://d:\dev\github\policy-tycoon\github\policy-tycoon\src\app\presentation\services\map-renderer.service.ts)

**Changes:**
- Modified `generateAndRenderTerrain()` to subscribe to terrain completion event
- Added `generateEnvironmentalFeaturesWithTerrainData()` method to generate environmental features only after terrain is complete
- Added `generateTreesWithTerrain()` method to implement proper tree distribution based on terrain type
- Added `selectTreeTypeForTerrain()` method to select appropriate tree types based on terrain

### 3. Key Features of the Fix

1. **Proper Synchronization:** Environmental features are now generated only after terrain generation is fully complete
2. **Terrain-Aware Tree Generation:** Trees are placed according to terrain type with proper distribution rules:
   - Trees are only placed on 1/3 of eligible terrain blocks
   - Water, sand, and peak height blocks are excluded
   - Mountain blocks get 0-2 trees
   - Other blocks get 0-3 trees
3. **Tree Type Selection:** Tree types are selected based on terrain type:
   - Grass: More oaks and pines
   - Hill: More pines
   - Mountain: More pines and birches

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Race Condition:** Environmental features are always generated after terrain is complete
2. **Proper Tree Distribution:** Trees follow the specified distribution rules based on terrain type
3. **Better Performance:** Environmental features are generated only when all terrain data is available
4. **More Realistic Environment:** Trees are placed according to terrain characteristics

## Testing

The changes have been implemented to ensure that:
- Terrain generation completes before environmental feature generation begins
- Trees are properly distributed according to terrain type
- The race condition between terrain and environmental feature generation is eliminated
