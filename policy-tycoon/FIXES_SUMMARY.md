# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve the race condition between terrain generation and environmental feature generation in the Policy Tycoon project.

## Issues Identified

1. **Race Condition**: Environmental features were being generated before terrain generation was complete
2. **Weird Spire Things**: Incorrect tree generation causing spire-like artifacts
3. **Premature Completion Messages**: "Terrain generation with chunking and instancing complete" appearing before actual completion

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. TerrainGenerationService Restoration

**File:** [src/app/application/services/terrain-generation.service.ts](file://d:\dev\github\policy-tycoon\github\policy-tycoon\src\app\application\services\terrain-generation.service.ts)

**Changes:**
- Removed the problematic EventEmitter `terrainComplete` that was causing issues
- Restored the original implementation without the EventEmitter
- Fixed syntax errors in the getHeightAt method
- Ensured proper completion handling within the generateWorld method

### 2. MapRendererService Fixes

**File:** [src/app/presentation/services/map-renderer.service.ts](file://d:\dev\github\policy-tycoon\github\policy-tycoon\src\app\presentation\services\map-renderer.service.ts)

**Changes:**
- Removed the problematic EventEmitter subscription that was causing the race condition
- Restored the original `generateAndRenderTerrain` method implementation
- Removed the incorrectly added methods that were causing the spire artifacts:
  - `generateEnvironmentalFeaturesWithTerrainData`
  - `generateTreesWithTerrain`
  - `selectTreeTypeForTerrain`
- Restored proper calling of the existing `generateEnvironmentalFeatures` method

### 3. Removed Spire Artifacts

The "weird spire things" were caused by the incorrectly implemented tree generation methods that were added to the MapRendererService. These have been removed, and the system now uses the original tree generation approach that was working correctly.

## Key Benefits

1. **Eliminated Race Condition**: Environmental features are now generated after terrain generation is complete
2. **Removed Spire Artifacts**: The weird spire things have been eliminated by removing the problematic tree generation code
3. **Proper Timing**: Terrain generation now completes fully before any environmental features are added
4. **Restored Functionality**: The system now works as it did before the problematic changes were introduced

## Verification

The fixes ensure that:
- Terrain generation completes fully before environmental features are generated
- No spire artifacts are generated
- The original tree generation approach is used
- Environmental features are properly placed after terrain is complete
