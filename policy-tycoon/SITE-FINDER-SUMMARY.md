# Site Finder Service Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the SiteFinderService, which provides intelligent site selection for city placement in the Policy Tycoon world generation system. The service implements a sophisticated algorithm that ensures cities are placed in areas with sufficient buildable space and appropriate terrain characteristics.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Site Selection Algorithm
- **Random Sampling**: Picks random locations within map bounds that haven't been checked yet
- **Area Calculation**: Uses breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate connected buildable areas
- **Validation**: Ensures each tile is above water level and passable from adjacent tiles
- **Filtering**: Only includes locations meeting minimum area requirements
- **Ranking**: Sorts locations by area size (largest first)

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation
- Accurately measures connected buildable areas
- Considers only directly adjacent tiles (not diagonal)
- Prevents overvaluing areas with disconnected sections
- Efficiently explores terrain

### 3. Water Detection Integration
- Works with TerrainGenerationService to identify water tiles
- Excludes water tiles from buildable areas

### 4. Passability Checking
- Uses CollisionDetectionService to ensure terrain is traversable
- Checks height differences between adjacent tiles

### 5. Duplicate Prevention
- Global tracking system prevents checking same tiles multiple times
- Improves search efficiency

## API

### Main Method
```typescript
findCityStartPoints(
  targetCityCount: number, 
  minAreaSize: number, 
  mapBounds: { minX: number, maxX: number, minZ: number, maxZ: number }
): CityStartPoint[]
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface CityStartPoint {
  x: number;        // X coordinate of the starting location
  z: number;        // Z coordinate of the starting location
  areaSize: number; // Number of connected buildable tiles
}
```

## Integration with Existing System

The SiteFinderService has been integrated into the ClassicCityGeneratorService, which now provides a new `generateCities()` method that:

1. Generates terrain first
2. Finds suitable starting points using SiteFinderService
3. Generates cities at each found location
4. Sizes cities appropriately based on available area

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Placement**: Cities only placed in areas that can support development
2. **Efficient Search**: Duplicate checking prevents wasted computation
3. **Scalable Cities**: Area size information enables appropriate city sizing
4. **Terrain Awareness**: Proper handling of water and impassable terrain
5. **Deterministic Results**: Consistent results given same terrain

## Testing

Unit tests have been created to verify:
- Basic functionality of finding city start points
- Proper handling of water tiles
- Minimum area size requirements
- Breadth-first search algorithm correctness
- Passability checking

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Create the service with its dependencies
const siteFinder = new SiteFinderService(terrainService, collisionService);

// Define search parameters
const mapBounds = { minX: -100, maxX: 100, minZ: -100, maxZ: 100 };
const targetCities = 10;
const minArea = 25; // Minimum 5x5 area

// Find suitable locations
const startPoints = siteFinder.findCityStartPoints(targetCities, minArea, mapBounds);

// Use the results for city generation
startPoints.forEach(point => {
  // Generate a city at point.x, point.z
  // Size can be determined by point.areaSize
});
```

## Demo Results

Testing the implementation shows it works correctly:
- Successfully identifies large connected buildable areas
- Properly excludes water tiles
- Handles edge cases gracefully
- Provides meaningful area size information for city sizing

This implementation significantly improves the quality and reliability of city placement in the Policy Tycoon world generation system.
